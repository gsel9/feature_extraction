setting:
  # Relaxing an eventual correlation between features and scanners due to
  # inter-scanner variability.
  normalize: True
  # Distance to neighbour: Specifies the distances between the center voxel and
  # the neighbor, for which angles should be generated. Only affects the GLCM
  # and NGTDM feature classes. The GLSZM and GLRLM feature classes use a fixed
  # distance of 1 (infinity norm) to define neighbours.
  distances: [1]

  # Value of ROI in binary mask.
  label: 1
  # Disable output of additional information from the extraction.
